create template for autoscaling groups: in this will create 2 instances(no public ip's) using vpc private subnets
for application deploying in private instances. we need to connect those instances but they are in private network. how to connect?
 using bastion host server we can copy the keys into bastion host.
 >launch instance name it as bastion host. copy the keys using that connect private ec2 instance and run appliaction.
 >go to load balencer and create it it gives DNS. through that we can access the application.

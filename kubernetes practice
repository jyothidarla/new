create a cluster: with 3 nodes(slaves/mineons)
install required softwares to set up:kubectl and eksctl.create a cluster. makesure you have configure <aws-iam-authorization>
#kubectl get nodes................it will show all the nodes in the machine.
#kubectl run --image nginx webserver.............it will run nginx container on nodes.
#kubectl get pods.............webserver pod is available. here pod is smallest layer object on top of a container. kubectl commands will communicate to the pod. inthis way irrespective of any underlyning architecture(dockerengine) it will
#kubectl get pods -o wide .........out of the 3 slaves i have where webserver contaainer is running? "its shows name of the nodes"
lets check which one has this name?
#kubectl get nodes. it will shows all the nodes info
> we know the that on the master machine there is a component called kubescheduler, it checks the h/w resources,which decides that whre the pod suppose to be created. its entirely its job.
>To know the entire details about pod: 
  #kubectl describe pods webserver<name> | less
  >its showing pod name, namespaces(logical partitions in the cluster,the pods are running the namespace cannot communicate with other pods running in the other namespace ).
  >(node_which machine)where its running, when its started, labels associated, image, whether its pod running status or not. all the info cames over here sec called "events" 
  To delete pods
  #kubectl delete pods webserver
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Imperative commands: using like cli for doing operations on files.
  
  #To create mysql as a pod.
  #kubctl run --image mysql:5 mydb<pod_name> --env MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWD=jyothi............pod as name mydb has been created.
  #kubectl get pods.....my pod is in running status.
  #kubectl get pods -o wide
  #kubectl exec -it mydb -- bash...it will enter into mysql environment.
  >>mysql -u root -p
   give that password. and execute the mysql commands.
   #kubectl delete pods mydb
  
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  use yaml files.

  >apiVersion:V1
   kind: which type of kubernetes obeject, that you have planning to create. or which type of kubernetes object you have to create.
         and for creating that objects it require some code libraries are necessary.when code lib is available then it can create kubenetes objects.
       , that is known as "apiVersion" .
       fro ex: if i want to create a pod, i want to have V1 codelibrary, imported, then process of pod has been created.
